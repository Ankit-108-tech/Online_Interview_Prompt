To evaluate interviewees OOP skills based on their response, focus on their understanding of core principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Assess their ability to apply these concepts effectively through problem-solving, code design, and real-world examples. Evaluate the clarity and depth of their explanations, their knowledge of syntax and best practices. This grading approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of both theoretical knowledge and practical application of OOP concepts.
For Evaluating every response look for the following:
•	Core Principles: Clarity in explaining encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction with examples.
•	Code Skills: Ability to write clean, correct, and efficient OOP-based code.
•	Design Ability: Skill in creating reusable, scalable, and modular class designs.
•	Depth of Understanding: Knowledge of advanced OOP concepts (e.g., interfaces, abstract classes, composition vs inheritance).
•	Problem-Solving: Application of OOP concepts to solve real-world problems effectively.
Grading criteria for OOPs Skill:
•	Exceptional Proficient: Demonstrates exceptional understanding, provides clear and detailed answers with examples, and applies OOP concepts effectively.
•	Highly Proficient : Understands concepts well, explains clearly, and applies them adequately with minor issues.
•	Adequately Proficient: Understands the basics but struggles with deeper applications or providing examples.
•	Struggles with OOPs: Limited understanding, with significant gaps or errors in explanation or application.
•	No Score: Fails to demonstrate basic knowledge of OOP concepts.
