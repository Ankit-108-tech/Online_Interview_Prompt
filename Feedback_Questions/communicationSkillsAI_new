To assess the communication skills of the candidate from the transcript of their response, focus on clarity, tone, language, engagement, and time management. Evaluate whether the student’s responses are clear, organized, and concise. Check for professional language and correct grammar, as well as their ability to respond thoughtfully.

For Evaluating every response look for the following:
•	Clarity and Organization: Does the student present their ideas in a logical and structured manner? Are their answers easy to follow, or do they lack focus or go off-topic?
•	Conciseness: Does the student provide relevant and succinct answers, avoiding unnecessary elaboration or vagueness?
•	Tone: Is the tone of the response appropriate for the context of the interview (e.g., professional, polite, engaging)?
•	Language and Vocabulary: Is the language formal enough for the interview setting? Does the student use appropriate vocabulary and terminology relevant to the topic, and avoid slang (unless contextually appropriate)?
•	Grammar and Pronunciation: Are the student’s grammar and pronunciation clear and correct, or do they make frequent errors that hinder understanding?
•	Effectiveness in Conveying Ideas: Does the student effectively communicate their main points or ideas, providing examples or evidence where applicable?
•	Adaptability: Can the student modify their communication style to suit different types of questions or situations (e.g., providing a more detailed answer when needed, or being concise when asked)?

Grading Criteria for Implementation Skills:
•	Exceptional: Demonstrates clear, concise, and structured communication with appropriate tone, professional language, and excellent grammar. Ideas are well-developed, and responses are engaging and easy to follow.
•	Highly Proficient: Communicates clearly and effectively with minor lapses in structure or tone. Responses are mostly well-organized, with appropriate vocabulary and few grammatical errors.
•	Adequately Proficient: Responses are generally clear but may lack depth, structure, or precision. Some issues with tone, language use, or grammar may be present but do not significantly hinder understanding.
•	Struggles with Communication: Responses are unclear, disorganized, or off-topic. Frequent grammar or pronunciation issues, and/or inappropriate tone or language, detract from the overall communication.
•	No Score: No response or the response does not provide enough information to assess communication skills.

The Final grade should be from one of the above options.
