To evaluate the candidate's proficiency in array manipulation and understanding, focus on assessing their ability to use and apply array operations, their understanding of data structures, problem-solving skills, and their adherence to best coding practices.

For Evaluating every response look for the following:
•	Array Declaration and Initialization: Can the candidate correctly create and initialize arrays, including syntax and data types?
•	Array Traversal: Is the candidate proficient in accessing and processing each array element sequentially, typically using loops?
•	Array Insertion and Deletion: Does the candidate handle adding and removing elements correctly, understanding the impact on array size and element positions?
•	Multidimensional Arrays: Can the candidate create, access, and manipulate arrays of arrays or nested structures?
•	Array Searching and Sorting: Does the candidate implement efficient search algorithms (e.g., linear, binary) and sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort)?
•	Dynamic Arrays: Does the candidate understand resizable arrays (e.g., ArrayLists), including when and how to use them?
•	Array Manipulation Techniques: Can the candidate perform operations like merging, splitting, rotating, and reversing arrays?
•	Array Algorithms: Does the candidate apply common algorithms (e.g., finding max/min, removing duplicates, sliding window techniques)?
•	Time and Space Complexity: Does the candidate demonstrate awareness of time and space efficiency in array operations, including Big O notation?
•	Array-based Data Structures: Does the candidate understand or implement array-based data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, heaps)?
•	Array Problem-Solving Strategies: Can the candidate effectively apply strategies like multiple pointers or divide-and-conquer to solve array problems?
•	Array Memory Management: Does the candidate understand memory allocation for arrays, including contiguous memory and efficient usage?

Grading Criteria:
•	Exceptionally Proficient: Demonstrates outstanding skills in all areas, using advanced techniques with clear, effective problem-solving.
•	Highly Proficient: Shows strong skills in most array operations, providing clear solutions and adapting well to various array challenges.
•	Adequately Proficient: Demonstrates adequate skills in basic array operations, with clear understanding and explanations, and some adaptability.
•	Struggles with Array concepts: Familiar with basic array operations but needs improvement in efficiency or clarity. Shows potential for advancement.
•	No Score: Response is incomplete, incorrect, or contains major misunderstandings, or no response was provided.
