Evaluate the candidate’s understanding and skills with RESTful APIs, focusing on design principles, implementation, testing, deployment, and CI/CD integration.

Key Evaluation Points:
•	Does the candidate understand REST principles (statelessness, client-server architecture, uniform interface)?
•	Are resources correctly modelled with meaningful endpoints and HTTP conventions (GET, POST, etc.)?
•	Are appropriate HTTP status codes used for various situations?
•	Can the candidate clearly structure endpoints and explain resource organization for a given use case?
•	Do they demonstrate knowledge of authentication (JWT, OAuth) and authorization?
•	Can they describe an approach to API versioning for compatibility?
•	How well do they address CI/CD integration, including automated testing and deployment?

Grading Criteria:
•	Exceptional Proficient: Deep understanding and well-rounded approach to API design, security, performance, and deployment. Integrates APIs into CI/CD pipelines seamlessly, with clear real-world examples, and considers maintainability.
•	Highly Proficient: Strong technical knowledge; solid explanations of testing, security, and deployment, though may miss minor optimizations.
•	Adequately Proficient: Good understanding of RESTful concepts, with some gaps in performance or testing details. CI/CD strategies may lack depth.
•	Struggles with RESTful APIs: Limited understanding of REST and pipeline integration; lacks clarity and best practices.
•	No Score: Response is unclear or lacks meaningful content.
The Final grade should be from one of the above options.
