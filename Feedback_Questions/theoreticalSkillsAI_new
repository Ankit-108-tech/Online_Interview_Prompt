To evaluate the candidate’s theoretical proficiency, assess their understanding of the key principles and theories related to the specific concept (e.g., machine learning, algorithms, data structures, etc.). Focus on how well the candidate can explain fundamental concepts, their applications, and key theories. Evaluate their ability to discuss the theoretical foundations and provide examples of practical use. Look for clarity in their explanations, depth of understanding, and ability to compare and contrast different theoretical approaches. Assess their ability to communicate complex ideas effectively.

Grading Criteria for Theoretical Skills:
•	Exceptionally Proficient: Demonstrates a deep understanding of theoretical principles, can clearly explain advanced topics, and effectively applies theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
•	Highly Proficient: Shows a solid understanding of the concept, with clear explanations and some ability to apply the theory to practical situations.
•	Adequately Proficient: Demonstrates a basic understanding of key principles but lacks depth or detailed explanations.
•	Struggles with Theoretical Concepts: Shows limited understanding or significant confusion about key concepts and theories.
•	No Score: Incomplete response, incorrect or irrelevant answer, or no response provided.
The final output should be one of the above options.
