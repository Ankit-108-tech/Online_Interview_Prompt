To assess a candidate’s Haskell proficiency, focus on their technical understanding, coding practices, problem-solving ability, and clarity of communication. This includes evaluating fundamental knowledge, functional programming concepts, type system usage, and performance optimization, along with how effectively they explain their approach.

For evaluating every response, look for the following:

Fundamental Understanding of Haskell: Assess their grasp of Haskell basics, including syntax, type system, and fundamental concepts like immutability and functional programming paradigms.

Knowledge of Functional Programming Principles: Evaluate their understanding of core functional programming concepts such as pure functions, higher-order functions, and function composition, as well as their ability to explain why these principles matter.

Type System and Type Classes: Evaluate their proficiency with Haskell’s strong static typing, type inference, and use of type classes (e.g., polymorphism and custom types), and how effectively they leverage these features in problem-solving.

Monads, Functors, and Higher-Order Functions: Gauge their understanding of Monads, Functors, Applicatives, and higher-order functions, including their ability to apply these constructs in sequencing operations, managing side effects, and creating efficient code.

Data Structures and Algebraic Data Types: Assess their knowledge of Haskell’s data structures (e.g., lists, tuples) and use of algebraic data types (ADTs) like `Maybe`, `Either`, and custom data types, noting their clarity in explaining these concepts.

Code Readability and Modularity: Evaluate their ability to write clean, modular code with clear naming and comments, and assess how they explain structuring code for readability and reuse.

Optimization and Performance: Evaluate their understanding of Haskell’s performance aspects, including lazy evaluation, space complexity, memory management, and performance trade-offs, along with debugging and error handling techniques using `Either` or `Maybe`.

Clarity of Approach: Assess how effectively they convey their answers, organize thoughts, and maintain clarity and conciseness throughout their responses.

Based on your assessment, select the option that best describes the candidate's proficiency:

Exceptionally Proficient: Demonstrates a deep understanding of Haskell with insightful, well-organized responses and clean, efficient code, demonstrating advanced problem-solving and trade-off analysis.

Highly Proficient: Displays good grasp of Haskell concepts and best practices, with clear, detailed answers and well-structured code. Effectively explains optimization, performance, and problem-solving strategies.

Adequately Sufficient: Shows basic understanding of Haskell fundamentals with generally clear responses. Can write functional code but may lack depth in advanced areas and clarity in optimization strategies.

Struggles with Haskell Programming Skills: Displays limited understanding of Haskell principles and struggles with clarity in responses. Coding lacks structure and does not follow best practices.

No Score: The candidate provides no response, or their response is so incomplete or unclear that it cannot be assessed.

The final output should be one of the above options.
