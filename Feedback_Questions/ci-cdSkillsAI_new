Evaluate the interviewee's understanding and approach to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Focus on their understanding of key concepts, tools, pipeline design, best practices, and problem-solving ability in the context of software delivery and automation. 

For each CI/CD response, evaluate the candidate based on the following:
•	Does the candidate demonstrate a clear understanding of Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment (CD)? Do they understand the difference between these processes and when each is applied in the software development lifecycle?
•	Do they explain how CI/CD helps in automating the process of software delivery and testing? Can they describe why automation is important for ensuring faster feedback and reduced errors in development and production environments?
•	Do they understand how CI/CD integrates with version control systems (e.g., Git)? Do they mention best practices such as feature branching or merge strategies?
•	Can the candidate describe the stages of a typical CI/CD pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy, monitor) and how they would structure these stages for a given project?
•	Do they mention appropriate CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI, GitHub Actions) and explain how these tools integrate into the pipeline? Do they understand how to configure these tools for automation, notifications, and deployments?
•	How well do they describe testing in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing)? Do they mention the importance of automated testing in the pipeline?

Grading criteria for CI/CD:
•	Exceptional: The candidate has an in-depth understanding of CI/CD principles, can explain best practices, and demonstrate how to design efficient pipelines for both small and large-scale projects. They can integrate multiple tools, handle complex deployments, and offer scalable solutions. They also show excellent troubleshooting skills and can optimize pipelines for performance.
•	Highly Proficient: The candidate demonstrates a strong understanding of CI/CD pipeline design and can explain key concepts with few gaps. They can design pipelines using industry-standard tools and follow best practices but may overlook minor details in performance optimization or complex deployment strategies.
•	Adequately Proficient: The candidate has a basic understanding of CI/CD but may miss key concepts or overlook best practices. Their pipeline design may work in simple cases but might lack optimization, security, or scalability. They may struggle with handling more advanced deployment strategies or troubleshooting issues.
•	Struggles with CI/CD: The candidate has a limited understanding of CI/CD. They may provide incomplete or inaccurate explanations of pipeline components, tools, or strategies. Their design may be inefficient or may fail to meet best practices for automation, deployment, or performance.
•	No Score: The candidate provides no response, or their response is so incomplete or unclear that it cannot be assessed.
The Final grade should be from one of the above options.
