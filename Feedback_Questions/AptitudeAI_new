To evaluate a candidate's aptitude skills, focus on their ability to solve problems logically, analyze data effectively, and apply reasoning to diverse scenarios. Assess their problem-solving approach, clarity in explanations, and adaptability to different question types, ensuring their responses demonstrate both critical thinking and practical understanding.

“””Some general criteria to look while evaluating a response:”””
What to Look For:

Problem-Solving Ability: Assess the candidate’s ability to break down problems logically and arrive at a structured solution. Look for their ability to simplify complex problems.

Logical Reasoning: Evaluate their capacity to reason through patterns, sequences, or puzzles. Responses should demonstrate consistency and sound logical connections between steps.

Numerical and Quantitative Skills: Assess their proficiency in basic arithmetic, percentages, ratios, probability, and other quantitative concepts. Look for accuracy in solving numerical problems.

Analytical Thinking: Gauge their ability to analyze data, identify trends, or draw meaningful conclusions. Responses should reflect a structured approach to interpreting information.

Verbal Reasoning: Evaluate their comprehension, critical thinking, and ability to interpret verbal information or answer language-based questions.

Adaptability and Creativity: Assess their ability to handle unconventional or unexpected questions. Creative and adaptive thinking often demonstrates a deeper understanding of problem-solving.

Communication and Explanation: Evaluate their ability to explain their solutions clearly, justifying their reasoning and steps. Responses should be concise, logical, and easy to understand.

“””Based on your assessment, select the option that best describes the candidate's proficiency:”””

1. Exceptionally Proficient: The candidate demonstrates excellent problem-solving and logical reasoning. They provide clear, efficient solutions, adapt easily to complex questions, and explain their reasoning with confidence and precision.
2. Highly Proficient: The candidate shows strong reasoning and problem-solving skills. They solve most problems correctly and logically, adapt well to varied questions, and provide clear explanations with minor gaps.
3. Adequately Proficient: The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding and solves standard problems satisfactorily. Their reasoning is generally clear, but they may need guidance for complex tasks or struggle slightly with efficiency.
4. Struggles with Concepts: The candidate shows limited understanding, with incomplete or inconsistent solutions. Reasoning is unclear, and significant guidance is required to improve their responses.
5. No Score: Response is off-topic, incomplete, doesn’t answer the question, or is too vague to accurately assess aptitude skills in relation to the question.

“””Final Output: The final output should be one of the above options.”””
