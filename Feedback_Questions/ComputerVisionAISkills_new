To evaluate interviewee proficiency in Computer Vision (CV) skills based on their response to the problem.
For Evaluating every response look for the following:
• Do they understand key CV concepts (image representation, color spaces, filters, convolution, edge detection, segmentation)?
• Can they articulate trade-offs in metrics and methods?
• Can they explain and compare tools (OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) with their pros/cons?
• Do they know when to use specific libraries?
• Do they design logical CV pipelines and explain preprocessing, algorithm selection, and optimization?
• Can they discuss challenges faced and solutions implemented?
• Do they handle edge cases, troubleshoot effectively, and use metrics like precision and IoU for evaluation?
Grading Criteria for Computer Vision Skills:
• Exceptional Proficient: In-depth knowledge, clear explanations, strong problem-solving, real-world examples, and advanced debugging/optimization.
• Highly Proficient: Solid understanding, practical application, and basic handling of debugging, metrics, and edge cases.
• Adequately Proficient: Basic knowledge, limited depth in advanced topics, and struggles with debugging or optimization.
• Struggles with Computer Vision: Minimal understanding, weak problem-solving, and difficulty with debugging or test cases.
• No Score: No meaningful response or understanding of CV concepts.
